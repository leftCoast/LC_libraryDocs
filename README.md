This is rolling along. Larger project than imagined. Odd that. Projects are ALWAYS larger than I imagine. You think I"d learn.

What phase are we in here? Still adding libraries to it. I mean, how many did I write? Seems like hundreds! But, since things are still being added, there's not a lot of proofreading going on. It's mostly just dumping in as much as I can, as quickly as possible. But, doing this is waking me up to the fact that, some of these libraries really need attention. And probably some rewriting.

I've also had to refactor some of my repositories to group together similar stuff and separate out other less related things. For example, separating SD card stuff from the GUI code was a nightmare. They had become so intertwined. But I like this better. Because now, you can do basic drawing to displays, without dragging all the SD card code along with it. Unless you need it.

**Current phase of this project :** Bulk adding sections about different libraries.

Well, the first pass is done. There is probably a lot of editing that could/should be done. Some bits are pretty thin. But, what's there, should accurate and up to dat with the curent code base. Most of the libraries that needed attention, got it. Some stuff ended up getting rewritten. There was a bunch of Wokwi simulator examples written and linked in. That should be a real help.

So go ahead and give it a look. If this stuff can help you with your projects, you are wlecome to give it a go.

**Current phase of this project :** It's all there, may not be totoaly pretty but it should be accutate.
