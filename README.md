This is rolling along. Larger project than imagined. Odd that. Projects are ALWAYS larger than I imagine. You think I"d learn.

What phase are we in here? Still adding libraries to it. I mean, how many did I write? Seems like hundreds! But, since things are still being added, there's not a lot of proofreading going on. It's mostly just dumping in as much as I can, as quickly as possible. But, doing this is waking me up to the fact that, some of these libraries really need attention. And probably some rewriting.

I've also had to refactor some of my repositories to group together similar stuff and separate out other less related things. For example, separating SD card stuff from the GUI code was a nightmare. They had become so intertwined. But I like this better. Because now, you can do basic drawing to displays, without dragging all the SD card code along with it. Unless you need it.

**Current phase of this project :** Bulk adding sections about different libraries.
